# People & Vehicle-Segmentation using CamVid-using-SAM2 and YOLO-Model
BASELINE VS IMPROVED PIPELINE
The core requirement is to implement the Segment Anything
Model 2 (SAM2) without any manual intervention,
such as clicking points or drawing boxes. I first establish
a simple baseline algorithm that uses a zero-shot object
detector to provide textual prompts and then introduce
an improved algorithm with enhanced techniques designed
to outperform this baseline. Performance is quantitatively
measured and compared using the Dice similarity coefficient.
